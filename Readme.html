<p>We have implemented 3 algorithms, Graham Scan, Kirk Patrick Seidel, and Jarvis March algorithms to find the convex hull in two dimensions.</p>

<p>As we can see the Kirk Patrick Seidel Algorithm is slightly expensive while initializing for smaller datasets, but for larger datasets gives quite good performance.</p>

<p>As we can see, during the starting the time taken for Graham Scan and Jarvis March, but after 1000 points we can see the disparity in the time taken to compute.</p>
